# tcfnpdecrypt
decrypt the encrypted name or password stored by SMS in a TCF File

The code allows you to decrypt the network access account info from a TCF file
stored by Systems Management Server for client distribution.

Sadly, they didn't put much effort into the encryption since a 3rd class
hacker like myself could break it.

Anyway...it's been over 10 years since it came into being so it shouldn't
be valid anymore. I intend to harm with it; it's for educational purpose only.
You can still find these files on the internet. Just Google for
"name password key network access account mobileclient.tcf"

Cheers!
